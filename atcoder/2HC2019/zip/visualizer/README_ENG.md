# Sample code for Hitachi Hokudai Labo and Hokkaido University Contest 2019

* This is an explanation of the visualizer used in the Hitachi Hokudai Labo and Hokkaido University Contest 2019. This Visualizer is the same as the Visualizer posted on the contest site.
* Please note that you are using the provided sample code on your own responsibility. In particular, neither Hokkaido University nor Hitachi Ltd. can be held responsible or liable, in case the execution of the provided sample code causes any damage to your computer.

## Sample code overview

The visualizer written JavaScript. Output to Problem A can visualized by opening the `index.html`  in sub-folder `/A`. Output to Problem A can visualized by opening the `index.html`  in sub-folder `/B`.

## About Problem A

A The following two files are required to run the visualizer.

- `testcase.in`: The input file processed by a contest algorithm in Problem A. It can be created using the `generator.cpp` described in the toolkit of Problem A.
- `result.out`: The output file which is created by the contest code when processing `testcase.in` as an input file.

In order to operate the visualizer, open the `index.html`  in sub-folder `/A` and point input to `testcase.in` and output to `result.out`.

As an example, `sample.in` and` sample.out` are prepared in `/A/sample`. You can use these to check the operation of the visualizer.

## About problme B

A The following two files are required to run the visualizer.
- `contestant.out`
- `judge.out`
These files can be created by running `interactive.py` as distributed with the contest toolkit for problem B. (For details, see the B issue `README.md`.)

In order to operate the visualizer, open the `index.html`  in sub-folder `/B` and point it to `contestant.out` and `judge.out`, respectively.

As an example, `contestant.out` and` judge.out` are prepared in `/B/sample`. You can use these to check the operation of the visualizer.
